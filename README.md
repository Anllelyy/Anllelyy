Cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, poses a significant global health challenge with far-reaching impacts. Its silent progression, affecting individuals of all demographics, underscores the urgency for proactive measures.
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk of heart disease. The dataset, anonymized and sourced from various hospitals, comprises 18 predictor variables and a response variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
The project involves data cleaning, analysis, and the application of machine learning algorithms to address imbalances and extends to additional algorithms, identifying crucial predictors, model selection, and error analysis. Beyond building accurate models, this endeavor contributes to the ongoing fight against cardiovascular diseases, fostering a healthier global future.
The data processing phase plays a pivotal role in uncovering insights from the database. Throughout this process, essential tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and reduction are undertaken to prepare the database for the application of analytical algorithms. The initial step involved identifying the data type of each predictive variable, a critical action for selecting and applying appropriate analysis methods. This encompasses tasks such as transforming categorical variables into dummy variables or normalizing numeric variables, essential actions to enhance data quality before implementing analytical techniques (Marktab, 2023).
